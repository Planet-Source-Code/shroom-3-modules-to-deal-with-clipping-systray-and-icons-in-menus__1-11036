## \_3 Modules to deal with Clipping, Systray, and Icons in Menus


</div>

### Description

Lets you set the minimum size your form can be (I haven't seen anything else like this, I did it cause I wanted a form of mine to not go below a size), Also provides a one-step way to add a bitmap to a menu item (someone submitted something like this in the previous day or two, although I didn't take my code from them), and an easy way to add your icon to the system tray.

This is my first submission, although I've been using PSC for a while now. I'ld appreciate any voting you could do. Also, comments are greatly appreciated. I'ld love it if you could fix any bugs you come across and send me an email!
